WunderlistConverter
===================

Tools to convert Wunderlist backups to other formats.  It's currently [just a standalone webpage](http://benjaminoakes.github.io/WunderlistConverter/) where you paste in your Wunderlist JSON.

Currently, the only output is Markdown.  It's meant as an example of how Wunderlist backups can be transformed into other formats.  Pull requests with additional formats are welcome!

The example GitHub-Flavored Markdown format looks like this:

     ## Inbox

       - [ ] Incomplete task

     ## List 1
     
       - [ ] 2013-01-08 Task with due date

     ## List 2

       - [ ] Starred task #star
       - [x] Completed task
